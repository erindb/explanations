## experiment to go with `infer-model.wppl` speaker2 model

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alice and Bob are attending a conference, and at the conference everyone gets a free t-shirt. Each person can choose to get a red shirt or a blue shirt.

Here's how Alice and bob choose their shirt colors: First Alice chooses her shirt color. Then, based on Alice's choice, Bob chooses his shirt color. Bob tries to choose the same shirt color as Alice (but with some low probability he might end up with a different color shirt from Alice).

It turns out that Alice chooses a red shirt and Bob chooses a blue shirt.

Your friend doesn't know how Alice and Bob chose their shirts or what color shirt Bob is wearing, but she notices that Alice has a red shirt. She asks you,

"Why does Alice have a red shirt?"

How much do you agree with the following responses:

Alice has a red shirt because she has a red shirt.
completely disagree -------[]------- completely agree

Alice has a red shirt because Bob has a blue shirt.
completely disagree -------[]------- completely agree

## Other causal models

Here's how Alice and Bob choose their shirt colors: First Bob chooses his shirt color. Then, based on Bob's choice, Alice chooses her shirt color. Alice tries to choose the same shirt color as Bob (but with some low probability she might end up with a different color shirt from Bob).

Here's how Alice and Bob choose their shirt colors: Alice and Bob choose their shirt colors independently.

Here's how Alice and Bob choose their shirt colors: First their mutual friend Carol chooses her shirt color. Then, based on Carol's choice, Alice and Bob choose their shirt colors. They try to choose the same shirt color as Carol (but with some low probability each of them might end up with a different color shirt from Carol). Alice and Bob don't see each other's shirt choice.
