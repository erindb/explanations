Alice and Bob are attending a conference, and at the conference everyone gets a free t-shirt. Each person can choose to get a red shirt or a blue shirt. Suppose you hear the following conversation:

"Why does Alice have a red shirt?"
"Because Bob has a red shirt."

How likely do you think it is that Alice and Bob chose their shirt colors in the following ways?

Alice chose her shirt color. Then, based on Alice's choice, Bob chose his shirt color.

Bob chose his shirt color. Then, based on Bob's choice, Alice chose her shirt color.
